# Pill Tracker Project

---

## Introduction

The application is primarily designed to be a program that can be used to 
track the number of medications taken over the course of a week. 
It can also be repurposed to keep track of other elements such as
water, or exercise despite the fact that the primary design and intention is for
medications. As such, anyone could use the application, but it will likely be most useful
to people who have medications that they have to take on a regular basis, whether that
be seniors who choose to take vitamin supplements, women on birth control or even 
people who frequently have to take pain-killers. Some aspects of code were sourced from the 
demos provided by the CPSC210 course.


This project is of interest to me because I think that many people could
benefit from having a digitalized way to keep track of pills or any other regular activity which 
encourages actively and continuously building a routine. Personally, keeping 
track and reminding myself to take vitamin D supplements is something I forget to do
even to this day. As such, I feel that having a simple and convenient application
to log behaviour would help people form healthy habits or improve on unhealthy ones.
